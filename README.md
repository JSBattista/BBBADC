Just some quick and dirty Beaglebone Black ADC with C Code for anybody who needs it. 
This is a quick and dirty C code ADC port tester for Beaglebone. Nothing special nor fancy about this one. When I go looking for "just get it done" code samples, I have to fish through forums and blogs. This is straight to the point. Just do it.
